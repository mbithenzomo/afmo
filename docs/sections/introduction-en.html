The AFMO has 12 top-level classes which can broadly be grouped into sensors and sensor data, personal information, and medical knowledge. Some classes in the AFMO are imported from the following ontologies: Disease Ontology, Evidence and Conclusion Ontology, FRBR-aligned Bibliographic Ontology (FaBiO), Friend of a Friend (FOAF) Ontology, Human Phenotype Ontology, SAREF Ontology, SAREF4Wear Ontology, and SAREF4health Ontology.
<br>
Health domain concepts have been manually cross-referenced to concepts from the Unified Medical Language System (UMLS) metathesaurus, which maps to several medical vocabularies and databases including SNOMED CT (US), Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) Thesaurus, National cancer Institute (NCI) Thesaurus, and MedlinePlus.</span>
