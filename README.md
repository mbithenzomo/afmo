## About
The Atrial Fibrillation Monitoring Ontology (AFMO) is a component of a hybrid AI architecture for personal health monitoring using heterogeneous and multimodal health data. It is designed to formally represent health data and expert knowledge for atrial fibrillation (AF) monitoring. This involves three key functionalities: AF detection, AF risk prediction, and decision support.

## Documentation
Coming soon.

## Ontology visualisations
The AFMO has 12 top-level classes which can broadly be grouped into sensors and sensor data, personal information, and medical knowledge.
